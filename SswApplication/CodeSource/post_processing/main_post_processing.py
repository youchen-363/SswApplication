#
# @section intro    Introduction
#                   This document describes the code for the post-processing of the SSW-2D data
#
# @section prereq   Prerequisites.
#                   Python packages: numpy, scipy, pywavelets, matplolib
#
# @section install  Installation procedure
#                   No installation. Just run the main program.
#
# @section run      Run main_post_processing \n
#                   1/ Fill the desired options in the inputs/configuration.csv file \n
#                   2/ Run main_post_processing

# @brief Computes and plots the demanded data from the final field and total wavelet parameters given by SSW
#
# @param[in]
# Inputs are defined in the files in the "inputs" directory
# - post_processing.csv that contains \n
# -- Data type:         Type of data to plot, may be 'E' (E-field), 'F' (propag factor), or 'S' (Poynting vector) \n
# -- Final field:       Plot the last calculation plane. 'Y' or 'N' \n
# -- Total field:       Plot the total field from the wavelet parameters. 'Y' or 'N' \n
# -- Dynamic:           Difference between the min and max value plotted (in dB) \n
#
# @param[out]
# Figures are saved in the "outputs" directory
#
# nota: the other parameters (frequency, wavelet, and so on) are read from the source and propagation modules
